        "description": "Released  In September 2019 a home owner found a young male koala in the backyard with her dogs and was concerned he may have been attacked. Our rescue team was despatched, and the young koala was captured. On examination at the Koala Hospital, staff were pleased to find he only had a laceration on one foot. They also found he had amazing, beautiful blue eyes. This is a very rare genetic phenomenon in koalas.  Lion Leo is now back in his home range and who knows, in the future, we may have more blue-eyed koalas from Leos’ offspring.",

        "description": "Hockey Luna was found low in a tree with blood on her head and neck. Once rescued we found a number of ticks on Lunas head and found that she was very sick with chlamydia. Luna was too young to be alone, so she was transferred to home care where she received constant treatment and care.  Once Hockey Luna was well enough to climb she was placed into a large enclosure and was soon on the road to recovery. She was released in 2019 near Laurieton.",
