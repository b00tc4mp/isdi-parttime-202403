Our rescue team was despatched, and the young koala was captured. On examination at the Koala Hospital, staff were pleased to find he only had a laceration on one foot. They also found he had amazing, beautiful blue eyes. This is a very rare genetic phenomenon in koalas.  Lion Leo is now back in his home range and who knows, in the future, we may have more blue-eyed koalas from Leosâ€™ offspring.","date":"2024-05-31 09:26"},{"id":"28675170366641645-1717156724421","author":"RotoJaz","title":"koala","image":"https://koalahospital.org.au/cdn/shop/products/f7p40CJBP5hB09Vp6TeSXFwMe0E_lion-leo-adoption-certificate.jpg?v=1608174739&width=600","description":"bla bla","date":"2024-05-31 13:58"},{"author":"RotoJaz","title":"Lion Leo","image":"https://koalahospital.org.au/cdn/shop/products/f7p40CJBP5hB09Vp6TeSXFwMe0E_lion-leo-adoption-certificate.jpg?v=1608174739&width=600","description":"Blah blah ","date":"2024-05-31 18:27","id":"4905735214136626-1717172843020"},{"author":"RotoJaz","title":"Debi","image":"https://cdn.britannica.com/26/162626-050-3534626F/Koala.jpg","description":"Prueba","date":"2024-05-31 19:37","id":"8422506284986642-1717177023434"}]
