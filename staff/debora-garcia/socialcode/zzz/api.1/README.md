Our rescue team was despatched, and the young koala was captured. On examination at the Koala Hospital, staff were pleased to find he only had a laceration on one foot. They also found he had amazing, beautiful blue eyes. This is a very rare genetic phenomenon in koalas.  Lion Leo is now back in his home range and who knows, in the future, we may have more blue-eyed koalas from Leosâ€™ offspring."}' -v
